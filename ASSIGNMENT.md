# MiniCRM Take-Home Assessment: Build Your Feature

## Overview
Welcome! This is a practical coding assessment designed to evaluate your full-stack development skills, creativity, and decision-making. You'll be adding **a feature of your choice** to our existing MiniCRM application.

---

## Background
MiniCRM is a simple customer relationship management application managing Leads, Contacts, and Reminders. Your task is to extend this system by implementing a feature that adds meaningful value to the CRM.

---

## Your Task
**Choose ONE feature to implement** that demonstrates your technical skills and product thinking. Your feature should:  

1. **Add meaningful value** to the CRM system  
2. **Include both backend and frontend components**  
3. **Integrate with existing models** (Leads, Contacts, or Reminders)  
4. **Be completable within the specified timelines**  
5. **Showcase your technical strengths**

## Implementation Guidelines

### Backend (Django REST Framework)
- Create at least one new model with proper fields and relationships  
- Implement RESTful endpoints: list, create, retrieve, update, delete  
- Include validation, error handling, and integration with existing models  
- Add meaningful docstrings for complex logic  

### Frontend (Vue 3 + Vuetify)
- Build a dedicated page or component for your feature  
- Provide full CRUD functionality  
- Handle loading states, error messages, and form validation  
- Integrate with existing pages and maintain responsive design  
- Create reusable components where appropriate  

### Testing
- Write a minimum of 5 meaningful tests covering positive & negative cases  
- Test business logic and edge cases  
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate  

### Code Quality
- Follow project patterns and conventions  
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Use meaningful variable and function names  
- Comment complex logic and handle errors properly

## Submission Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
- Clone the repository locally and follow the `README.md` setup instructions.  

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Develop, Commit, and Document
- Implement your feature in the feature branch.
- Make descriptive commits as you develop.
- Create a `SOLUTION.md` file in the root directory covering:
  - Feature choice & rationale
  - Technical approach & design decisions
  - Implementation details
  - Challenges & trade-offs
  - Setup & testing instructions
  - Future improvements
  - Database Migrations
- Include all migration files.
- Ensure migrations run successfully on a fresh database.

### 4. Share Your Repository
- Push your branch to a public repository.
- Share the link to your repository as your submission.
- Ensure the repository includes your `SOLUTION.md`.

### Review Process
We will:
- Check out your feature branch
- Review code changes
- Read your `SOLUTION.md`
- Follow setup instructions to run the application
- Test feature functionality
- Run the test suite
- Make sure your code runs successfully on a fresh checkout

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Thoughtful scope:** Is the feature appropriately sized?
- **Full-stack skills:** Quality of backend and frontend implementation
- **Product sense:** Does it solve a real problem?
- **Code craftsmanship:** Is the code production-ready?
- **Problem-solving:** How challenges were handled
- **Communication:** Clarity of explanations and documentation

### Guidance & Notes
- Scope your feature to complete within the timelines.
- Ensure code runs successfully; we will test it.
- We expect original work; do not copy solutions.
- A well-implemented, focused feature is preferred over a half-finished ambitious one.
- Be creative and showcase your strengths.
- Questions? Make reasonable assumptions (document in `SOLUTION.md`) or email dev@smartstaffingsupport.com if truly blocked.

### Submission Deadline
Please submit your solution within the specified timelines. Your feature branch should be pushed to your repository by the deadline.

Good luck! We're excited to see your solution.

Happy Coding 🚀
